# Summary: Bayesian Inference Implementation

## Executive Summary

This implementation transforms the FARFAN 2.0 framework from a deterministic pattern extraction system into a **Bayesian causal inference engine**. Three major innovations ("Agujas") have been implemented that introduce formal probabilistic reasoning throughout the causal analysis pipeline.

## What Changed

### Before (Deterministic)
- Causal links had fixed strength values (0.8)
- Mechanisms were extracted but not validated
- Audits produced simple pass/fail results
- No uncertainty quantification
- No prioritization of findings

### After (Bayesian Probabilistic)
- Causal links have posterior probability distributions with uncertainty bounds
- Mechanisms are inferred using hierarchical Bayesian models
- Audits use counterfactual reasoning to assess causal impact
- Every inference includes uncertainty quantification
- Findings are prioritized by expected value of information

## The Three Agujas

### 1. AGUJA I: El Prior Informado Adaptativo
**File**: `dereck_beach`, class `CausalExtractor`, method `_extract_causal_links()`

**What it does**: Transforms causal link extraction from regex matching to Bayesian inference

**Key innovation**: Instead of saying "this link exists with 80% strength", it now says:
- "This link has a posterior probability of 0.795 ± 0.165"
- "The belief has converged (KL divergence < 0.01)"
- "Evidence includes 5 independent sources"

**New capabilities**:
- Semantic distance scoring using spaCy embeddings
- Type transition priors (programa→producto→resultado→impacto)
- Language specificity assessment (epistemic certainty)
- Temporal coherence validation (verb sequences)
- Financial consistency checking
- Textual proximity analysis
- Convergence tracking with KL divergence

### 2. AGUJA II: El Modelo Generativo de Mecanismos
**File**: `dereck_beach`, new class `BayesianMechanismInference`

**What it does**: Infers latent causal mechanisms using hierarchical Bayesian modeling

**Key innovation**: Builds a 3-level generative model:
1. **Hyperprior**: Domain-level mechanism type distribution
2. **Prior**: Typical activity sequences per mechanism type
3. **Likelihood**: Observed textual evidence

**New capabilities**:
- Mechanism type inference (administrativo, técnico, financiero, político)
- Activity sequence parameter estimation (Markov chains)
- Coherence scoring across multiple factors
- Sufficiency tests: Can this mechanism produce the outcome?
- Necessity tests: Is this mechanism unique?
- Uncertainty quantification using entropy
- Automatic gap detection with severity levels

### 3. AGUJA III: El Auditor Contrafactual Bayesiano
**File**: `dereck_beach`, class `OperationalizationAuditor`, method `bayesian_counterfactual_audit()`

**What it does**: Performs counterfactual causal reasoning to detect missing components

**Key innovation**: Uses Pearl's do-calculus to ask:
- "What would happen if we omit component X?" 
- P(failure | do(omit_X)) vs P(failure | do(include_X))

**New capabilities**:
- 3-layer probabilistic audit:
  - Layer 1: Direct evidence (what's missing?)
  - Layer 2: Causal implications (what does this cause?)
  - Layer 3: Systemic risk (how does it affect the whole?)
- Historical prior enrichment
- Expected Value of Information (EVI) for prioritization
- Optimal remediation ordering

## Integration

All three agujas are seamlessly integrated into the main `CDAFFramework` pipeline:

```
Step 1: PDF extraction
Step 2: Causal hierarchy (uses AGUJA I) ← BAYESIAN LINKS
Step 3: Entity-Activity extraction
Step 4: Financial traceability
Step 4.5: Mechanism inference (AGUJA II) ← NEW
Step 5: Operationalization audit
Step 5.5: Counterfactual audit (AGUJA III) ← NEW
Step 6: Causal inference setup
Step 7: Traditional reports
Step 8: Bayesian reports ← NEW
```

## New Outputs

Three new output files per document:

1. **`{policy_code}_bayesian_mechanisms.json`**
   - Inferred mechanism types with posteriors
   - Activity sequences with transition probabilities
   - Sufficiency and necessity test results
   - Uncertainty metrics
   - Detected gaps with suggestions

2. **`{policy_code}_counterfactual_audit.json`**
   - Direct evidence audit results
   - Causal implications of omissions
   - Systemic risk assessment
   - Prioritized recommendations with EVI scores

3. **`{policy_code}_bayesian_summary.md`**
   - Human-readable summary
   - Top 5 prioritized recommendations
   - Overall success probability estimate
   - Risk score

## Impact Metrics

### Precision
- **Before**: Binary decisions
- **After**: Probability distributions with credible intervals

### Insight Depth
- **Before**: "Link exists"
- **After**: "Link has 79.5% probability, based on 6 evidence types, converged after 3 updates"

### Actionability
- **Before**: Unordered list of issues
- **After**: Prioritized by Expected Value: fixing X yields 0.85 impact with effort 3 → priority 0.28

### Learning Capability
- **Before**: Static rules
- **After**: Priors can be updated from historical data across documents

## Technical Footprint

### Code Changes
- **Lines added**: ~1,000 lines of Bayesian inference code
- **New class**: `BayesianMechanismInference` (350 lines)
- **Enhanced classes**: 
  - `CausalExtractor`: +300 lines
  - `OperationalizationAuditor`: +350 lines
  - `CDAFFramework`: +60 lines

### Dependencies Added
- `numpy`: Numerical computation
- `scipy.spatial.distance`: Cosine similarity
- `scipy.special`: KL divergence (rel_entr)
- `scipy.stats`: Beta distribution

(All already available in scientific Python ecosystem)

### Performance
- Minimal overhead: Bayesian updates are O(evidence_count)
- Semantic distance requires spaCy embeddings (already loaded)
- No MCMC sampling (using approximate inference) → fast

## Validation

### Structural Validation
```
✓ 8/8 Bayesian methods in CausalExtractor
✓ 9/9 methods in BayesianMechanismInference
✓ 6/6 methods in OperationalizationAuditor counterfactual audit
✓ Integration in CDAFFramework verified
```

### Demonstration
Interactive demo (`demo_bayesian_agujas.py`) successfully shows:
- AGUJA I: Posterior distribution calculation
- AGUJA II: Mechanism type inference with uncertainty
- AGUJA III: Counterfactual reasoning and prioritization

## Usage

No changes to user interface:

```bash
python dereck_beach documento.pdf --policy-code PDM_2024 --output-dir results/
```

But now produces additional Bayesian outputs automatically.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Full MCMC**: Replace approximate inference with PyMC3/NumPyro for exact posteriors
2. **Historical Learning**: Accumulate priors across multiple documents
3. **Interactive What-If**: Web interface for intervention simulation
4. **Causal Discovery**: Infer DAG structure, not just parameters
5. **Meta-Analysis**: Compare plans in latent mechanism space

## Paradigm Shift

This implementation represents a fundamental shift:

**From**: Document analysis tool  
**To**: Causal inference engine

**From**: Pattern matching  
**To**: Probabilistic reasoning

**From**: Static assessment  
**To**: Learning system

**From**: "What's here?"  
**To**: "What should be here? What's the impact of what's missing?"
