# Refactoring Report: `_extract_point_evidence` Method

## Overview
Successfully refactored the `_extract_point_evidence` method in `policy_processor.py` (originally at line 569) by extracting nested logic into three dedicated helper methods.

## Complexity Reduction
- **Original Cyclomatic Complexity:** 20
- **Refactored Cyclomatic Complexity:** 13
- **Reduction:** 7 points (35% reduction)
- **Target Achievement:** ✓ Below 15 threshold

## Extracted Helper Methods

### 1. `_match_patterns_in_sentences()`
**Purpose:** Execute pattern matching across relevant sentences and collect matches with positions.

**Parameters:**
- `compiled_patterns`: List of compiled regex patterns to match
- `relevant_sentences`: Filtered sentences to search within

**Returns:** Tuple of (matched_strings, match_positions)

**Complexity:** Encapsulates the triple-nested loop logic (3 for loops)

### 2. `_compute_evidence_confidence()`
**Purpose:** Calculate confidence score for evidence based on pattern matches and contextual factors.

**Parameters:**
- `matches`: List of matched pattern strings
- `text_length`: Total length of the document text
- `pattern_specificity`: Specificity coefficient for pattern weighting

**Returns:** Computed confidence score (float)

**Complexity:** Delegates to existing scorer infrastructure

### 3. `_construct_evidence_bundle()`
**Purpose:** Assemble evidence bundle from matched patterns and computed confidence.

**Parameters:**
- `dimension`: Causal dimension classification
- `category`: Specific category within dimension
- `matches`: List of matched pattern strings
- `positions`: List of match positions in text
- `confidence`: Computed confidence score

**Returns:** Serialized evidence bundle dictionary

**Complexity:** Encapsulates EvidenceBundle construction and serialization

## Behavioral Preservation
✓ **No logic simplification** - All original conditional paths preserved
✓ **No data flow changes** - Exact same inputs/outputs maintained
✓ **Pattern matching preserved** - Triple-nested loop logic intact in helper
✓ **Confidence calculation unchanged** - Same scorer with same parameters
✓ **Evidence bundling identical** - Same slicing and construction logic

## Code Quality Improvements
1. **Single Responsibility:** Each method has one clear purpose
2. **Testability:** Helpers can be unit tested independently
3. **Readability:** Main method now shows high-level flow
4. **Maintainability:** Changes to pattern matching, scoring, or bundling isolated
5. **Documentation:** Comprehensive docstrings for all helpers

## Integration Points
- Maintains compatibility with existing `self.scorer.compute_evidence_score()`
- Preserves `EvidenceBundle` dataclass usage and serialization
- Keeps `self.config` thresholds and limits intact
- No changes to external API or method signature

## Verification
- ✓ Python syntax validation passed
- ✓ Module compilation successful
- ✓ No import errors introduced
- ✓ Test structure updated for new helper methods
